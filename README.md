# Modern-New-Tab-Page-NoAd
The Ad removed version of Modern New Tab Page extension for chrome browser.

An short introduction for the original version goes [here](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/11/16/8-chrome-extensions-transform-new-tab-page/4/) .

I like the Modern New Tab Page extension but Chrome seems starting to disable it as it violates the policy of Chrome Web Store because of Ads.

This version has no Ad. Chrome cannot identify it hence Chrome wouldn't disable it.

## Install (if you trust me more)
1. Download from [here](http://eaufavor.info/modern_new_tab_page.crx) .
2. Drag the crx file to chrome://extensions/ page.

## Install (if you trust me less)
1. Clone this repo.
2. Verify the code is safe to use by yourself.
3. Pack the code using "Pack extension" at chrome://extensions/ page.
2. Drag the crx file to chrome://extensions/ page.

### Redistribution
If someone dares to publish this version on Chrome Web Store, be my guest.
