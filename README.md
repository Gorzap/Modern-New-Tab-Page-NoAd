# Modern-New-Tab-Page-NoAd
The Ad removed version of Modern New Tab Page extension for chrome browser.

An short introduction for the original version goes [here](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/11/16/8-chrome-extensions-transform-new-tab-page/4/) .

I like the Modern New Tab Page extension but Chrome seems starting to disable it as it violates the policy of Chrome Web Store because of Ads.

This version has no Ad. Chrome cannot identify it hence Chrome wouldn't disable it.

## Install (chrome seems to block this way)
1. Download from [here](http://eaufavor.info/Modern-New-Tab-Page-NoAd.crx) .
2. Drag the crx file to chrome://extensions/ page.

## Install (this works so far)
1. Clone this repo.
2. (optional)Verify the code is safe to use by yourself.
3. Enable developer mode at chrome://extensions/ page.
2. Choose "load unpacked extension...", and then select the directory of the repo you just cloned.

### Redistribution
If someone dares to publish this version on Chrome Web Store, be my guest.

### Change-log
2015.2.26 Retrieve permissions to fix RSS (Is it really fixed?). 
(I lost/changed the packing key also. So it ends up as a new extension if the crx file is is used. Rememberer to export and import the settings from the old extension.)
